As mentioned before the game is built using the FarSeer Pyshics Engine version 3.2 (FPE). This is an open source physics engine for XNA. To cut down on the development time, we decided to use this as it handles 2D collision detection and has a lot of physics features. Of these features, we are using the collision detection and basic gravity and reflection physics.

The overarching architecture is modelled after the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. This makes it easy get get an overview of the project as it strictly differentiates between data, views and input/data handling. 

The game also makes extensive use of the Observer Pattern(OP) and State Machines. 

Some structures in the game can be serialized to the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) standard.
