\section{Introduction}
This document is a description of the product delivered by Team X2 in the course TDT4240 Software Architecture. The document contains design, and implementation details, tests results from testing done during development and on the final product, the user manual, and a discussion on the architecture implementation.\\

During development the main focus was on modifiability. The game has the possibility to be expanded with new features, characters, maps and power ups. The game uses the FarSeer Physics Engine 3.2 (FPE) a COTS for physics simulation and collision detection. FPE lets the developer easily create new dynamic objects in the game world, which could be used to create dynamic levels at a later date.
