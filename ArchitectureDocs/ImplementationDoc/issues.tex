The main problem we have experienced during this project was the lack of time and experience. As well as communication problems with inn the group and different programming experience and habits. As our first try as software architects we underestimated the value of creating a detailed architecture and fast-forward towards the implementation. This resulted in an architectural-drift and erosion lowering the required quality of the product and increasing the implementation time.
With a better planed out and detailed architecture, many of issues and problems we have encountered would be solved. For instance the use of the FarseerPhysics engine that we thought would save some of implementation time ended up causing an architectural drift. Next time we’ll be more careful in our choice and usage of COTs. And gather enough knowledge and understanding of bough developing platform and COT, before taking a next step.
If we were to start again from scratch we would try to stay closer to chosen architecture and use more time to think over the product. We would choose our architectural/design patterns more wisely a consideration to the environment/platform we’ll use. As well as create more detailed views, so it will be more informative for the stakeholders. Specially the developing view.
